UnitaryHACK is very different from the rest of the hackathon-style events in the quantum computing space because **contributions support existing quantum computing projects**, pay people for their work, and help build critical professional skills like working on OSS or quantum computing stack tools. We want this event to show folks what amazing projects are out there, and help you find new ways and people to help grow your projects. We have added to the webpage what you can expect [before and during the event](https://unitaryhack.dev/project-guide/), as well as the [rules for the event](https://unitaryhack.dev/rules/).


To get started with unitaryHACK, **[SIGN UP HERE](https://unitaryhack.dev/)**

We have more than **31 participating projects and over 100 bounties**! You can find the [full list here](https://unitaryhack.dev/projects/), which includes:

unitaryHACK is made possible by the **maintainers** volunteering time to review pull requests and engage with the community during Office Hours held on Unitary Fundâ€™s Discord server.

unitaryHACK is **supported by generous donations**: from AWS and Classiq; from Unitary Fund members - IBM and Scientifica, as core members - and Agnostiq, AWS, Cisco, DoraHacks, Pasqal, Quandela, and Qyber, as supporting members.
