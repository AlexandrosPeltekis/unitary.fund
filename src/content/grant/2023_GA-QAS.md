To **Viet Tan Nguyen** to further develop **[GA-QAS: a genetic approach to quantum compilation](https://github.com/vutuanhai237/GA-QAS/tree/main)**, to solve the manual finding of a suitable trainable unitary by automatically finding a near-optimal ansatz given the target quantum objective functions.
