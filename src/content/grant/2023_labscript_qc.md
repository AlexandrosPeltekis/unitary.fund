To **Fred Jendrzejewski** to develop an SDK that allows cold atom research groups to make their experiments more accessible. The project has advanced quite substantially and the initial code has been merged with the **[sqooler](https://github.com/Alqor-UG/sqooler)** package such that theorists and experimentalists have a common framework. The system is now in a phase where it is looking for beta testers for the [hardware control](https://github.com/Alqor-UG/labscript-qc-example) as well as for the [simulator](https://github.com/Alqor-UG/sqooler-example) packages.
