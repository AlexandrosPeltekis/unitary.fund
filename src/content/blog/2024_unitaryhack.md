The Unitary Fund hackathon supporting quantum open source projects is happening now! [unitaryHACK](https://unitaryhack.dev/) is a virtual event encouraging people to make contributions to the open source quantum ecosystem. The event will run **May 29-June 12, 2024**, and hackers have the opportunity to win cash bounties! unitaryHACK is unique to many quantum hackathon-style events for two big reasons:

- Hackers support existing quantum computing projects. 
- Hackers get paid for their work while building professional skills such as working on open source projects, and contributing to create a more functional, and featured, quantum computing stack.

For more information, read our hacker guide and check out what happened in [unitaryHACK 2023](https://unitary.fund/posts/unitaryhack_wrap/) and get connected on our [Discord server](http://discord.unitary.fund)!
