# Unitary Fund Q1 2024 Update - 100  microgrants, unitaryHACK, new research and project updates

Dear Unitary Fund community,

We are excited to share our 2024 Q1 quarterly update! We reached a huge milestone, surpassing 100 microgrants given to the community to support quantum open source projects. These microgrants have been awarded to people in 30 countries, resulting in 25+ papers, 40+ libraries, 100+ contributors and about 6k commits (excluding QuTip), 2 startups and 1 non-profit. A huge thank you to our members who make this work possible!
