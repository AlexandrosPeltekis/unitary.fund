# Unitary Fund Q1 2024 Update - 100  microgrants, unitaryHACK, new research and project updates

Dear Unitary Fund community,

We are excited to share our 2024 Q1 quarterly update! We reached a huge milestone, surpassing 100 microgrants given to the community to support quantum open source projects. These microgrants have been awarded to people in 30 countries, resulting in 25+ papers, 40+ libraries, 100+ contributors and about 6k commits (excluding QuTip), 2 startups and 1 non-profit. A huge thank you to our members who make this work possible!

We awarded 7 new grants in Q1, including integration of Mitiq into OpenQAOA, building quantum programming content platforms, a quantum education initiative for girls in France and Venezuela, an entanglement toolbox for t-doped stabilizer states, and more! Additional details on each grant are available below.

We have also been hard at work preparing for our 4th edition of [unitaryHACK](https://unitaryhack.dev/), an international virtual open-source hackathon where we give quantum projects cash to distribute to contributors by means of bounties. Last year, unitaryHACK had 700 participants and 72 hackers claimed 99 bounties, with more than $11k awarded. With over 30 registered projects and more to come, this yearâ€™s unitaryHACK is shaping up to be the largest one yet. If you would like to host an in-person meetup in your city to give your local community a space to gather, form teams, and work on unitaryHACK bounties, email <info@unitary.fund>. to let us know! And make sure to [register](https://unitaryhack.dev/register) to participate for your cash prize! 

This summer we will be hosting a Mitiq workshop as part of the summer school on Numerical Methods in Quantum Information Science, taking place in Boston. The school will cover best practices in software engineering, as well as the fundamentals of high-performance modeling techniques including state vector master equations, tensor networks, and the stabilizer formalism and its generalizations -- crucial tools in modeling quantum hardware and error correction. Multiple hackathons will be executed where instructors will be able to help you with your own research projects. To register for the school and to see more details, please go to [qnumerics.org](https://qnumerics.org/).

Thank you all for your continued support of the open-source quantum ecosystem!
