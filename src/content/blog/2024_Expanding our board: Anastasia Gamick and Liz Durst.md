# Expanding our board: Anastasia Gamick and Liz Durst

As the quantum technology ecosystem grows, Unitary Fund’s mission becomes more and more important. I am excited to announce that we are growing our own support with two new additions to our board: [Anastasia Gamick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anastasiagamick/) and [Liz Durst](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lizdurst/).

Anastasia is Co-founder and Chief Operating Officer at Convergent Research, where she builds and incubates new kinds of transformative research institutions. I have a huge amount of respect for the work that she and Convergent are doing and for the ambition that they have. We are thrilled to have her expertise and support as we grow Unitary Fund. Unitary Fund is in many ways a unique institution in a new field and Anastasia is someone I turn to when we have a one-of-one challenge.

"I'm honored to join Unitary Fund's Board. With experience in nonprofit governance and operations, including scaling nonprofits for greater impact, I look forward to supporting Unitary Fund's mission of an equitable quantum future.” - Anastasia Gamick
