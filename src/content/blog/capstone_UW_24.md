Together with industry professionals and academic mentors, our group completed the University of Washington’s Accelerating Quantum-Enabled Technologies (AQET) capstone course. We worked with the Unitary Fund to create a pipeline and GUI using the Mitiq library, with the hopes of allowing users to compare the effectiveness of various quantum error mitigation methods. Our focus was on the potential overhead of quantum computations could have and developed methods to streamline the comparison of overheads for quantum error mitigation techniques.

I'm Alexandros Peltekis, a first year Ph.D. student in Chemistry at the University of Washington. I am in the Li Group. I do research relating to Quantum Chemistry and am helping in the development of the group’s open-source software package called Chronus Quantum..


## Our Project
### The Process
Week 1-2: Diving into Mitiq and Quantum Computing We started by familiarizing ourselves with Mitiq’s architecture and functionalities. This involved reading documentation, playing around with some of the error mitigations and asking many questions.
Week 3-5: Executors, MetaData, and the GUI These weeks we became accustomed with Mitiq’s executor functions, implemented Mitiq’s ZNE into our pipeline, set up metadata generation, and started GUI integration.
Week 6-8: Testing and Refining With the core components in place, we spent this time implementing other Quantum Error Mitigation methods such as Probabilistic error cancellation (PEC).
Week 9-10: Finalizing and Presentation In the final weeks, we added finishing touches to the pipeline and Gui and prepared for their presentations. We participated in Unitary Fund’s Quantum Wednesday and presented at a couple of our university’s poster sessions.

### Results

### Our Contribution: A Tool for Comparison
In our project, we aimed to create a comprehensive tool that makes it easier for users to compare these QEM methods. We developed:
1. A Pipeline for QEM Comparison: Our pipeline evaluates the performance and computational overhead of different QEM techniques, providing a structured framework for comparison.
2. A User-Friendly GUI: We designed an intuitive graphical user interface that simplifies the process of visualizing and comparing the results of different QEM techniques.
