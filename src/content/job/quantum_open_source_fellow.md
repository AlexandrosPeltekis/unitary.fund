[Unitary Fund](https://unitary.fund/) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit research group helping build a quantum technology industry that benefits the most people. We support the community, e.g., running a grant program to support the development of new open source quantum software, and we do our own research on key projects for the ecosystem.

## Role - Quantum Open Source Fellow
We’re hiring for quantum open source fellows to work on Unitary Fund open source research projects on quantum software with a focus on the Mitiq open-source ecosystem. 
You will develop software and perform research as part of a sponsored research project led by Unitary Fund, in collaboration with key players from the industry and research sector.
Through this project you’ll be at the center of the emerging field of quantum computing and working to develop new and critical components to accelerate it.

You will develop Mitiq and other quantum software projects in its ecosystem. You will further implement best practices in the open source software development of Mitiq, by focusing on increasing the testing, security, privacy, and robustness of continuous integration (CI) and continuous development (CD). You will improve the quality of the Mitiq documentation, by interfacing with contributors to provide support with regard to new tutorials’ contribution, with advice and support on technical writing and documentation infrastructure guidelines. Infrastructure in the Mitiq open-source ecosystem also means facilitating the interface with cloud service providing access to real or simulated QPUs.
This is a full-time position. This is a one year position with possibility for renewal. Unitary Fund is a fully remote team and this role is also remote.

**Applications are open. Submit your application [here](https://airtable.com/appbH8Vrpz5msbGRd/shrwSaPiE4suXCIxp).**

## About You:
- 2+ years of software engineering work experience (not necessarily quantum related) OR 2+ years of research experience in quantum information such as in a PhD program
- Track record of building and launching software with small teams
- Excited to make quantum technologies better, easier, and more accessible

## Bonuses: 
- Track record of learning/building with quantum computing packages and software (e.g. any of these open source projects)
- Experience with full stack web development
- Being an active member of the Unitary Fund community
- Experience as Mitiq user or contributor
- Experience with cloud-accessible QPUs

## WORK HOURS & BENEFITS
**Flexible Hours** - We are happy to accommodate complex schedules or limitations, and care more about the work getting done than the times you’re sitting at your computer.

**Alignment** - Being a small team, we will be seeking a collaborator who aligns with our culture, we would love for it to be a delight to work together.
