[Unitary Fund](https://unitary.fund/) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit research group helping build a quantum technology industry that benefits the most people. We support the community, e.g., running a grant program to support the development of new open source quantum software, and we do our own research on key projects for the ecosystem.

## Role - Member of the Technical Staff
We’re hiring Members of Technical Staff to work on Unitary Fund software research projects focused on quantum error mitigation.
